# Mario AI framework

This is a *very slightly* edited version of the original [Mario AI framework](https://github.com/amidos2006/Mario-AI-Framework). The only "new" functionality is that it asks for the level location on the command line rather than having to change the `src` directly.

Please refer to the [Mario AI framework](https://github.com/amidos2006/Mario-AI-Framework) official Git repo for anything.
